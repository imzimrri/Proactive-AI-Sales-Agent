Product Requirements Document (PRD): Proactive AI Sales Agent

1. Introduction
   This document outlines the product requirements for a "Proactive AI Sales Agent," a voice-powered AI designed to instantly convert website leads into qualified sales consultations. The initial target market is solo service professionals, starting with personal trainers. The primary goal is to solve the "speed to lead" problem by creating a system that engages potential clients the moment they show interest, dramatically increasing the likelihood of conversion.

2. Problem Statement
   Many small service businesses rely on "Contact Us" forms on their websites to generate leads. However, solo business owners are often busy serving existing clients and can take hours or even days to respond. By then, the lead has gone cold, moved on to a competitor, or lost interest. This slow lead response time is a major source of lost revenue and missed opportunities.

3. Solution Overview
   The Proactive AI Sales Agent reverses the traditional model. Instead of waiting for a client to call, the agent proactively calls the client.
   - **The Trigger:** A potential client submits a contact form on the business owner's website.
   - **The Action:** Within seconds, the AI agent initiates an outbound phone call to the lead.
   - **The Goal:** The agent engages the lead in a conversation with the single objective of booking a free 15-minute introductory consultation directly into the business owner's calendar.

4. Target Audience
   - **Primary User (MVP):** A solo personal trainer who wants to convert more website visitors into clients.
   - **Secondary User:** A potential client who has just filled out the trainer's contact form.

5. Product Features (MVP)
   The following features will be included in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to be built in a 5-hour hackathon. The focus is on a simple, robust, and impressive demo.

   - **Web Form Trigger:** The system will be triggered by a simulated web form submission containing a name and phone number.
   - **Outbound Voice Call:** The agent will immediately initiate an outbound call using Vapi.
   - **Focused Conversation Flow:** The agent's script will be minimal and focused on a single goal:
     1. Greet the lead (e.g., "Hi, this is the AI assistant for [Trainer's Name]. I see you just filled out a form on the website.").
     2. State the purpose (e.g., "I'm calling to get you booked for your free 15-minute consultation.").
     3. Ask one or two simple qualifying questions (e.g., "What's your primary fitness goal?").
     4. Propose a time for the consultation.
     5. Confirm the booking and end the call.
   - **Simulated Booking:** For the MVP, the agent will confirm the booking verbally. A direct calendar integration is not required. A simple notification (email or webhook) will be sent to the business owner with the lead's details.

6. Future Enhancements
   These features are beyond the scope of the hackathon MVP but form the vision for a scalable SaaS product.

   - **Self-Service Platform:** A dashboard where business owners can sign up, configure their agent, and manage settings.
   - **Payment Integration:** Combine the agent with a payment gateway like Stripe to take deposits or full payment for sessions, reducing no-shows.
   - **Sales Funnel Features:**
     - **Upselling:** Train the agent to offer premium packages (e.g., multi-session bundles, nutrition plans).
     - **Downselling:** Offer lower-cost alternatives if a client is hesitant (e.g., group sessions).
     - **Lead Magnets:** Offer to text free content like e-books or workout guides to nurture leads.
   - **Agent Customization:**
     - **Personality:** Allow users to choose a personality for their agent (e.g., "Hype Coach," "Zen Master").
     - **Voice:** Select from a variety of male and female voices.
   - **Market Expansion:** Adapt the platform for other service-based verticals like law firms, barbershops, physical therapists, and real estate agents.
   - **Full Calendar Integration:** Connect directly to Google Calendar or Outlook to read availability and write appointments automatically.

7. Dependencies & Tools
   - **Vapi:** Core service for managing outbound, voice-powered AI conversations.
   - **Strands Agents:** The agent framework for building the conversational logic.
   - **FriendliAI (Optional):** Can be used to accelerate model inference for faster, more natural responses.

8. Success Metrics
   - **MVP:** A successful live demonstration of the agent making a proactive, outbound call triggered by a form submission and successfully booking a consultation.
   - **Future:** Key metrics will include lead-to-call connection rate, call-to-booking conversion rate, and ultimately, revenue generated by the agent for its users.
